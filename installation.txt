Step 1:
Install MySQL dependencies for ODB (already installed on cluster)
	- mysql-server
	- libmysqlclient-dev
	
Step 2:
Setup rootless MySQL database
	- Download MySQL source code (with boost) https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
	- Unpack to mysql-VERSION)
	- Configure GCC as compiler
	- Set the following CMake Vars
		- BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR: should point to */mysql_VERSION/boost/boost_VERSION
		- LOCAL_BOOST_DIR: should be same as above
		- WITH_BOOST:  should point to */mysql_VERSION/boost
	- If you install to a local dir, e.g. $HOME/local, set the following paths
		- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: $HOME/local/mysql
		- MYSQL_DATADIR: $HOME/local/mysql/database
		- MYSQL_KEYRINGDIR: $HOME/local/mysql/keyring
	- Build by invoking "make" and "make install"
	- MySQL should now be installed in $HOME/local/mysql
		- consider adding /bin at the beginning of $PATH
		- mkdir $HOME/local/mysql/etc
		- create $HOME/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf with contents as in attached example
	- Setup database by calling
		- mysqld --initialize-insecure
			- this initializes the server
		- mysqld
			- this actually starts the server
		- mysql -u root --skip-password
			- connects to the server
		- ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
			- this is executed from mysql shell
		- exit
			- to exit mysql shell
	
Step 3:
Install ODB from http://codesynthesis.com/products/odb/download.xhtml
	- ODB Compiler (I recommend using a precompiled binary)
	- libodb
		- call configure script with argument --prefix=$HOME/local
	- libodb-mysql
		- call configure script with argument --prefix=$HOME/local
		
Step 4:
Install RapidJSON from https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson
	- git clone
	- cmake
		- replace /usr/local by $HOME/local in all cmake vars
	- make, make install
	
Step 5:
Install pistache from https://github.com/oktal/pistache
	- git clone
	- cmake
		- replace /usr/local by $HOME/local in all cmake vars
	- make, make install
	
Step 6:
Install InDiProv from https://github.com/cyremur/InDiProv
	- CMAKE Vars
		- LIBODBDB_INCLUDE_PATH: $HOME/local/include
		- LIBODBDB_LIBRARY: $HOME/local/libodb-mysql-2.4.so
		- LIBODB_INCLUDE_PATH: $HOME/local/include
		- LIBODB_LIBRARY: $HOME/local/lib/libodb-2.4.so
		- PISTACHE_INCLUDE_PATH: $HOME/local/include/pistache
		- PISTACHE_LIBRARY: $HOME/local/lib/libnet.so
	- start server
		- server --user root --password password --database provenance --socket $HOME/local/mysql/mysql.sock
