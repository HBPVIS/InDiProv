Creating new Activity returns the unique id of new Activity if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities\&. Just as entities cover a broad range of notions, activities can cover a broad range of notions: information processing activities may for example move, copy, or duplicate digital entities; physical activities can include driving a car between two locations or printing a book\&.
.br
 Example: An activity may be the publishing of a document on the Web, sending a twitter message, extracting metadata embedded in a file, driving a car from Boston to Cambridge, assembling a data set based on a set of measurements, performing a statistical analysis over a data set, sorting news items according to some criteria, running a SPARQL query over a triple store, or editing a file\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setAgent (stringlabel, stringlocation, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Agent returns the unique id of new Agent if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. For many purposes, a key consideration for deciding whether something is reliable and/or trustworthy is knowing who or what was reponsible for its production\&. Data published by a respected independent organization may be considered more trustworthy than that from a lobby organization; a claim by a well-known scientist with an established track record may be more believed than a claim by a new student; a calculation performed by an established software library may be more reliable than by a one-off program\&. An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity\&. An agent may be a particular type of entity or activity\&. This means that the model can be used to express provenance of the agents themselves\&.
.br
 Example: Software for checking the use of grammar in a document may be defined as an agent of a document preparation activity; one can also describe its provenance, including for instance the vendor and the version history\&. A site selling books on the Web, the services involved in the processing of orders, and the companies hosting them are also agents\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setEntity (stringlabel, stringlocation, stringtype, stringval)"

.PP
Creating new Entity returns the unique id of new Entity if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary\&.
.br
 Example: An entity may be the document at IRI http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17526723, a file in a file system, a car, or an idea\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setused (intactID, intentID, stringusedTime, stringlabel, stringlocation, stringrole, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Usage returns the unique id of new usage if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Activities and entities are associated with each other in two different ways: activities utilize entities and activities produce entities\&. The act of utilizing or producing an entity may have a duration\&. The term 'generation' refers to the completion of the act of producing; likewise, the term 'usage' refers to the beginning of the act of utilizing entities\&. Thus, we define the following concepts of generation and usage\&. Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity\&. Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and could not have been affected by the entity\&.
.br
 Example 1: Usage examples include a procedure beginning to consume an argument, a service starting to read a value on a port, a program beginning to read a configuration file, or the point at which an ingredient, such as eggs, is being added in a baking activity\&. Usage may entirely consume an entity (e\&.g\&. eggs are no longer available after being added to the mix); in contrast, the same entity may be used multiple times, possibly by different activities (e\&.g\&. a file on a file system can be read indefinitely)\&.
.br
 Example 2: Let us consider the activity of driving a car from Boston to Cambridge\&. One might reasonably ask what entities are used and generated by this activity\&. This is answered by considering that a single artifact may correspond to several entities; in this case, a car in Boston may be a different entity from the same car in Cambridge\&. Thus, among other things, an entity 'car in Boston' would be used, and a new entity 'car in Cambridge' would be generated by this activity of driving\&. The provenance trace of the car might include: designed in Japan, manufactured in Korea, shipped to Boston USA, purchased by customer, driven to Cambridge, serviced by engineer in Cambridge, etc\&., all of which might be important information when deciding whether or not it represents a sensible second-hand purchase\&. Or some of it might alternatively be relevant when trying to determine the truth of a web page reporting a traffic violation involving that car\&. This breadth of provenance allows descriptions of interactions between physical and digital artifacts\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasAssociatedWith (intactID, intagentID, intplanID, stringlabel, stringrole, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Association returns the unique id of new Association if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Agents are defined as having some kind of responsibility for activities\&. An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity\&.
.br
 Example: Examples of association between an activity and an agent are:
.br
 creation of a web page under the guidance of a designer;
.br
 various forms of participation in a panel discussion, including audience member, panelist, or panel chair;
.br
 a public event, sponsored by a company, and hosted by a museum;
.br
 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasAttributedTo (intentID, intagentID, stringlabel, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Attribution returns the unique id of new Attribution if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Agents can be related to entities, activities, and other agents\&. Attribution is the ascribing of an entity to an agent\&.
.br
 Example: EA blog post can be attributed to an author, a mobile phone to its manufacturer\&.
.br
 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasDerivedFrom (intgenEntID, intusdEntID, intactID, intgenID, intusgID, stringlabel, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Derivation returns the unique id of new Derivation if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Activities utilize entities and produce entities\&. In some cases, utilizing an entity influences the creation of another in some way\&. This notion of 'influence' is captured by derivations, defined as follows\&. A derivation is a transformation of an entity into another, an update of an entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity\&.
.br
 Example: Examples of derivation include the transformation of a relational table into a linked data set, the transformation of a canvas into a painting, the transportation of a work of art from London to New York, and a physical transformation such as the melting of ice into water\&.
.br
 The focus of derivation is on connecting a generated entity to a used entity\&. While the basic idea is simple, the concept of derivation can be quite subtle: implicit is the notion that the generated entity was affected in some way by the used entity\&. If an artifact was used by an activity that also generated a new artifact, it does not always follow that the second artifact was derived from the first\&. In the activity of creating a painting, an artist may have mixed some paint that was never actually applied to the canvas: the painting would typically not be considered a derivation from the unused paint\&. PROV does not attempt to specify the conditions under which derivations exist; rather, derivation is considered to have been determined by unspecified means\&. Thus, while a chain of usage and generation is necessary for a derivation to hold between entities, it is not sufficient; some form of influence occurring during the activities involved is also needed\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasEndedBy (intactID, intentID, intenderActID, stringeTime, stringlabel, stringlocation, stringrole, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new returns the unique id of new if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. End is when an activity is deemed to have been ended by an entity, known as trigger\&. The activity no longer exists after its end\&. Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity precedes the activity's end\&. An end may refer to a trigger entity that terminated the activity, or to an activity, known as ender that generated the trigger\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasGeneratedBy (intentID, intactID, stringgenerateTime, stringlabel, stringlocation, stringrole, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Generation returns the unique id of new Generation if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Activities and entities are associated with each other in two different ways: activities utilize entities and activities produce entities\&. The act of utilizing or producing an entity may have a duration\&. The term 'generation' refers to the completion of the act of producing; likewise, the term 'usage' refers to the beginning of the act of utilizing entities\&. Thus, we define the following concepts of generation and usage\&. Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity\&. This entity did not exist before generation and becomes available for usage after this generation\&.
.br
 Example: Examples of generation are the completed creation of a file by a program, the completed creation of a linked data set, and the completed publication of a new version of a document\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasInformedBy (intinformed, intinformant, stringlabel, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Communication returns the unique id of new Communication if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. The generation of an entity by an activity and its subsequent usage by another activity is termed communication\&. Communication is the exchange of some unspecified entity by two activities, one activity using some entity generated by the other\&.
.br
 Example: The activity of writing a celebrity article was informed by (a communication instance) the activity of intercepting voicemails\&. 
.SS "int InDiProvClient::setwasStartedBy (intactID, intentID, intstarterActID, stringsTime, stringlabel, stringlocation, stringrole, stringtype)"

.PP
Creating new Start returns the unique id of new Start if the function is successful, else returns -1\&. Start is when an activity is deemed to have been started by an entity, known as trigger\&. The activity did not exist before its start\&. Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity follows the activity's start\&. A start may refer to a trigger entity that set off the activity, or to an activity, known as starter, that generated the trigger\&.
